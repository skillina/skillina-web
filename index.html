	Well, there's really nothing to see here. The past week or so I've felt like I've been lacking particular direction; I've been spinning in circles.
	So I'm going to try to redeem my New Year's Resoluton (that truly never saw the light of day) to paint my GitHub account green again. Step one
	in that plan involves building my web site. I've had this domain for over a year now (minus almost a semester in which I was so inattentive to
	one of my email accounts that I failed to realize that my domain had expired) but there's never been a single meaningful thing posted on the
	homepage; it's only really served to host some backend stuff for app development I had been working on.<br /> <br />

	Well, that's coming to a close, since I really need to get back into programming. Everything is really barebones right now; index.html hasn't even
	touched Git yet. This consciousness dump (calling it anything more refined than that is being far too generous) isn't funneled through any CMS,
	it's just straight into the html from emacs. And certainly I don't have any delusion that this is actually being read by anyone out there; it's
	pretty much just for me, and if anyone happens to stumble upon it, well, you can decide for yourself if that means anything to you. <br /><br />

	At this stage all this writing is for myself. This page has no true reason to exist, and this message even less so: I should be writing code
	(or sleeping) instead of droning on to the void. That said, this is going to stay. I don't really know what this is going to be yet; I'm hoping
	to keep it as minimal as possible. The content should do the talking, whenever that arrives (and I hope that's soon!). This is nothing but a
	canvas. I'll do what I can to make it look pretty, but at the end of the day I live more for the backend of software development, and fully
	admit that what I think makes a web site look good may be very different from what anyone else wants to see. We'll see how it goes. <br /> <br />
