    <p>2018-01-06 <br /> <br />
	New year new habits. One of those habits is pushing progress on some project of mine at least four days per week.
	Not counting blog updates to this site, ideally. This web site truly has been neglected, and it's a great regret of mine.
	I wish I had put more effort into getting things up-and-running around here. Unfortunately some perfectionism tends to let
	great become the enemy of good. But truly, projects need to progress. All too often I let myself get caught up in the
	flow of the semester and fail to write code for myself. If I'm writing code for assignments and for my boat, I owe it to
	myself to work on something I truly chose every so often. <br /> <br />

	I'm well aware these likely go into the abyss at this point, but writing these status updates ideally serves as another way
	for me to keep myself on-track. This one, on a subject of more personal development rather than the school-focused recordkeeping
	I do on paper. Here's to a year of active commit histories.<br /> <br />
